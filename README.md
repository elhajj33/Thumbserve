# Thumbserve

The intention of this project was to make a fat32 drive available for Resin 3D Printers able to only read fat 32 USB drives.

<div> HARDWARE </div>
This project was developed and tested using a RaspberryPi Zero 2 W. You can pick one fairly cheaply on amazon (see <a href="https://amzn.to/3nKTyhV"> link </a> if you don't already have a raspberrypi)
<br><br>
Important note: the installer will create an 8gb drive make sure you have at least a 16gb SD card

You will also need a data capable USB cable.  Many USB cables act only as charger cables; such cables will not work.
